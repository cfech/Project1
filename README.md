What's Happening Philly is a web based application that allows users to search for various events taking place in Philadelphia. 

The user is able to search for specific events or general categories within a specific time frame. Once a search has been initiated, a list 

will populate providing all events that match the users search criteria. The event list provides useful information for the user about the 

event such as the name of the event. 

The application was built using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. We also utilize several APIs, web development processes, that are listed below:
